# Mobile FTP Client Implementation Report

## Project Overview

The Mobile FTP Client application is a web-based FTP client featuring a Spring Boot backend and React/TypeScript frontend. It allows users to:

1. Authenticate with FTP server credentials
2. Browse directories and files on the FTP server
3. Navigate through the folder structure with breadcrumbs
4. View detailed file information

## Implementation Status

### Fully Implemented Features

#### Backend (Spring Boot)

✅ **Authentication System**
- JWT-based authentication with proper token generation using HS256 algorithm
- Token validity period of 24 hours
- Debug mode for testing without a real FTP server
- Password validation on backend

✅ **FTP Directory Browsing**
- Directory listing API endpoint
- Mock data support for testing environments
- Error handling and proper HTTP status codes

✅ **Security**
- Enhanced CORS configuration with specific origins and credentials support
- No password storage in responses
- Token validation on protected endpoints

#### Frontend (React/TypeScript/Material UI)

✅ **Authentication**
- Login screen with form validation
- JWT token storage in localStorage
- Authentication context for state management
- Protected routes

✅ **FTP Browser**
- Directory listing with file/folder icons
- Navigation through directories
- Breadcrumb navigation for path tracking
- File details display (size, date modified, permissions)
- Loading indicators and error handling

✅ **Documentation**
- Setup instructions
- Testing guidelines
- Quick-start script

### Planned But Not Implemented Features

#### File Operations
- File uploads
- File downloads
- File/directory creation
- File/directory deletion

#### Additional Features
- File search functionality
- File preview capabilities
- Connection management for multiple FTP servers
- User preferences storage

## Technical Implementation Details

### Authentication Flow

1. User provides FTP server credentials (host, port, username, password)
2. Backend validates credentials (in debug mode or against actual FTP server)
3. Backend generates JWT token containing session information
4. Frontend stores token in localStorage
5. Token is sent with subsequent API requests

### CORS Configuration

Enhanced CORS configuration has been implemented in WebConfig.java to allow secure cross-origin requests:

- Specific allowed origins: `http://localhost:5173`, `http://localhost:5174`, `http://127.0.0.1:5173`, `http://127.0.0.1:5174`
- Credentials support enabled for secure cookie/token transmission
- All headers and methods allowed for development
- Preflight cache duration set to 1 hour (3600 seconds)

### Directory Browsing Flow

1. Frontend requests directory listing with path and credentials
2. Backend connects to FTP server (or generates mock data in debug mode)
3. Backend retrieves file list and converts to DTOs
4. Frontend displays files/folders with appropriate icons
5. User can navigate by clicking on directories

### Key Components

#### Backend
- `AuthController` - Handles login requests
- `FtpController` - Handles FTP operations
- `JwtTokenProvider` - Manages JWT token generation and validation
- `FtpService` - Business logic for FTP operations
- `FtpRepository` - Data access layer for FTP operations

#### Frontend

- `LoginScreen` - User authentication form
- `FtpBrowserScreen` - Directory browsing interface
- `AuthContext` - Authentication state management
- `ftpService` - API client for FTP operations
- `authService` - API client for authentication

## Testing Results

The application has been thoroughly tested in debug mode with the following results:

- **Login**: Successfully authenticates with test credentials
- **Directory Listing**: Properly displays mock files and directories
- **Navigation**: Correctly navigates between directories
- **Breadcrumbs**: Properly tracks and displays current path
- **Error Handling**: Displays appropriate messages for errors
- **CORS**: Successfully handles cross-origin requests with appropriate headers

## Deployment Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Java 21
- Node.js and npm
- Gradle

### Quick Start

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `chmod +x start.sh` to make the start script executable
3. Run `./start.sh` to start both backend and frontend
4. Access the application at the URL displayed in the terminal
5. Log in with credentials: `test` / `password` (in debug mode)

## Future Enhancements

### Short-term Improvements

1. Implement file download functionality
2. Add file upload capability
3. Create file/directory management operations (create, rename, delete)
4. Add proper CORS configuration for production environment

### Long-term Vision

1. Add support for multiple FTP servers
2. Implement file preview for common file types
3. Add search functionality
4. Create mobile app using React Native with the same backend
5. Implement enhanced security measures (HTTPS, environment variables for secrets)

## Conclusion

The Mobile FTP Client application successfully implements the core functionality of authenticating with an FTP server and browsing its directory structure. The application is ready for testing and further feature development. The debug mode provides a realistic environment for testing without requiring an actual FTP server.

The enhanced CORS configuration ensures secure communication between the frontend and backend components, addressing potential security concerns while maintaining functionality. The comprehensive error handling provides users with meaningful feedback, improving the overall user experience.

With a solid foundation in place, the application can be easily extended with additional features like file uploads, downloads, and enhanced security measures. The architecture follows best practices for separation of concerns, making the codebase maintainable and scalable for future development.
